- Why do we need smoothing?

Smoothing is required to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight
longer-term trends. It is used to remove noise (short term fluctuations)

- How does the window size affect the result

The larger the window size, the stronger the effect of smoothing.
A small relative size will not allow to see major trends
while a relative large size will hide details one might be interested in.
Thus the window size should be picked carefully, with respect
to the processed data.
